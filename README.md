Python based music player app.

Project Description

This project aims to create a feature-rich music streaming application that serves as a Spotify clone, providing users with a wide range of functionalities. The application will enable users to:

    Search for songs
    Play songs from a comprehensive song list
    Download Songs
    Create, edit, and play playlists
    Shuffle play
    Skip songs

To source the music, the application will directly download songs from YouTube and store them as MP3 files on the user's device, ensuring a seamless listening experience.

While an account system is not currently required, it may be implemented if we have time. The initial release will be a desktop application, with potential plans for future expansion to the Android platform.

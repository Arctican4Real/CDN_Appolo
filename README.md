### Specifications

To search for music, the [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/) is currently being used.

To source the music, the application will directly download songs from YouTube with [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) and store them as MP3 files on the user's device.

A database system will be implemented to help with keeping track of all the songs, as well as a playlist system

The initial release will be a desktop application, with potential plans for future expansion to the Android platform.

*While an account system is not currently required, it may be implemented if we have time.*
